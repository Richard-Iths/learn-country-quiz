# 9 - Suggest Improvements
Now that you've been working in a trunk based project using many kind of feature flags, you are asked to reflect around your experience.

- What did you like with this work method?

We like the fact that you can switch between the states of the application, it builds a good testing enviroment!

- What didn't you like?

Its alot of setup for a just a litte bit of functionality. We think that it would work best with a bigger project then a smaller one, when a team releases alot of functions in the same release.

- Can you come up with a couple of ideas for how to improve the workflow?
 Â°
	- A change in culture in the dev team?
	
	It helps if remind each other to push :)
	You can also set up goals, for instance: push every time you are done with a function.

	- Some improvements to your build pipeline?
	- Some improvements for how to build feature flags? Maybe using a 3rd party tool for it?

Don't forget to [put a green checkmark](README.md) before you continue to the next task!
